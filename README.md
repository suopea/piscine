Tests for hive piscine


# Evaluating

1. `git clone` the code to be evaluated, **giving it a name cXX**, so lowercase c and the project number. Otherwise the tests won't work. For example `git clone URL_FROM_INTRA c01`
2. Without changing directory after the previous clone, clone the tests using `git clone https://github.com/suopea/piscine.git testbest` (test program should work with any name for this)
3. These automated tests won't check if there are any unnecessary files in the evaluated reaository. Check that there are no unnecessary files on the evaluated repository manually 
4. `cd` to the **test repository**. The test program only works when run from its own repository
5. If you're testing for c01, ex05, run `sh test.sh 01 05`. So first argument is project number, second argument is exercise number

So the structure should be:

``` 
some directory / c01 (the repository of the evaluated person) / ex00, ex01 etc
some directory / testbest (this repository) / c01, c02 etc / ex00, ex01 etc
```

For even easier testing, you can run `alias tt='sh test.sh'. After that you can do for example `tt 01 05`
