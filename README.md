Tests for hive piscine


# Evaluating

1. `clone` the code to be evaluated, **giving it a name like c01**. (not C01) 
2. check that there are no unnecessary files on the evaluated repository (test.sh will not test for extra files)
3. clone the tests using `git clone https://github.com/suopea/piscine.git` (name  doesn't matter)
4. `cd` to the test repository created on previous step
5. test by running `sh test.sh PROJECT EXERCISE`, for example `sh test.sh 01 05` for project C01, exercise 05
